## Configuration ##
One of the best things is, hands down, the ability to configure everything.
I recomment reading through both the Default and the User configuration files.
The Default one is very, very well documented and will give you an idea about
what exactly is configurable.

## Key  Bindings ##
I grew up using eclipse and know now most of the eclipse keybindings
by heart. So I changed the Sublime Keybindings to reflect the eclipse one.

## Packages ##
I have a large number of packages installed, mostly because I like syntax highlighting.
