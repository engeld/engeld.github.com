Once a month we have 24 hours for ourselves to hack on anything we want.

The only conditions are:  

 - The project must be announced beforehand.
 - It must be do-able in 24 hours.

Now, with those conditions in mind, I start looking for a good and interesting idea.


To make this easier, I decided on some further conditions for me:

 - If its a software project and uses an API, then it should be using a swiss API.
