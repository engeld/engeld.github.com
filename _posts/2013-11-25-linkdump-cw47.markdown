title: "Linkdump Week 47"

---

This week, I struggled with my jailbroken iPhone 5 (stil on 6.1.2) which freezes when I unplugg/plug in my headphones and/or randomly reboots.
So unsurprisingly, most of the links this week are about this. But alas, I still haven't found a solution other than restore my iPhone onto iOS 7 and send it to the apple care guys.
But I'm wary about that because I a) have bad experience with apple care/apple support and b) I'm not eager to lose my jailbreak.

Other than that, I'm fiddling with Icinga/Nagios and its plugins so there are some links about this as well.

Oh, and I started a new side project to brush up my rusty ruby: [trakt-cli](https://github.com/engeld/trakt-cli)
