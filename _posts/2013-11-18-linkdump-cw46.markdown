title: "Linkdump Week 46"

---

This week, I *finally* updated [my blog][] and changed the design. Many thanks to [duetsch][] for
the design-inspiration (it's based on his ancient theme which he used back in 2010-ish when his old blog was still active).

Other stuff I did this week:  

  - I installed [mavericks][] on my [Macbook Air][macbook-air] which was straightforward but time-intensive
  - I'm testing [airmail][] for my [uberspace][]-hosted mails but I'm not yet convinced, I think I'll still switch to alpine

And without any further ado, here's the linkdump:
